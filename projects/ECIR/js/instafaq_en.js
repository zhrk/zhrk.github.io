But what if you could add 1000+ different neutral comments just with one (or few) templates?</p><p>This is possible with <span class="redactor-invisible-space">Instalex.pro</span>! We implemented support of Spintax format for the comments and now its as easy as pleasant. <br><br></p><p>What is Spintax? You can read some bits of information on the Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_spinning" target="_blank">Article spinning</a>. But we would like to add some more details.<br><br></p><p>Spintax is a writing format used to "spin" or re-write existing content. The main purpose is to create many unique articles from one source article. Take a look at the next example: "{Nice|Cool} photo!". Each time when this phrase is posted as a comment the "{Nice|Cool}" part will be "unspinned" and we will get two different comments: "Nice photo!" and "Cool photo!". <br><br>Really cool and easy, right?<br><br></p><p>There are no limits on how many Spintax parts can be used in the comment. </p><p>Furthermore, you can use Nested Spintax format:<br>"{This {photo|image}|Your {shot|picture}} looks {nice|cool|awesome}!" and get 12 absolutely different comments. Some of them:<br>"This photo looks cool!", "Your picture looks nice!".<br><br></p><p>The more variety you use in your Spintax templates the more different comments you get. Just have a look at this monstrous example:<br><br></p><p>"{|||Wow! |Hey! |Looks {nice|cool}! }{{I like|I love|Like|Love} {this|your}|{Very nice|Nice|Cool}} {photo|foto|picture|pic|image|img}{.|!|!!| :)| ;)| :D| &lt;3}"<br><br></p><p>It gives you 2058 (!) unique comments like these: "Wow! I like this photo :D", "Looks cool! Very nice pic!!", "Cool image!" etc.<br><br></p><p>Please, feel free to share your ideas and Spintax examples in the comments to this blog post!</p></div>'

          'How To Find Targets For Promotion?', 
          '<div><p>The most frequently asked questions are how many promos do I need, how to find a good target for promotion etc. So Ive decided to explain you all this stuff.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Instagram Promo Strategy, What To Do</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You can add an unlimited number of promos. Please have a look here on how to add promos. The promos do not work all at the same time. It doesnt make sense because each account has daily/hourly limits, which we cannot jump over.</p><p>Promos work one by one and you can have unlimited promos at NoWorriesBot. </p><p>So its logical to have many promos, the more of them - the better. </p><p>Now how does It work like:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>You add 10 promos</li><li>Wait for 2-3 days</li><li>Look at the conversion rate shown below each added promo. Conversion rate is the percentage of users that followed you back after you performed some actions on their accounts (post a like, comment or follow)</li><li>Get rid of all the bad promos with the lowest conversion rate. For reference 10% is a good conversion rate. Below 5% is low.</li><li>Repeat.</li></ol><p>This is the general approach. Now lets get to the second important question.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where To Find Good Target Accounts</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Target account is a popular account in your niche. You create a promo specifying this account as a target and the system likes, comments and follows their followers so that they would follow you back.</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, you sell boots. </p><p>Then tier 1 target accounts which would be Instagram online stores that sell boots. </p><p>Tier 2 would be all other clothing and accessories stores, like dresses, watches, belts etc. </p><p>Tier 3 would be followers of fashion blogs. </p><p>For each tier Id normally look for accounts that have at least 10K followers. Its OK to take smaller, but they just finish sooner (where theres no one left to act upon). </p><p>I dont usually take super huge accounts, like 500K, they usually work a little worser, but you can still try and see if it works for your needs.</p><p><br></p><p>If you planify to use "Only likers and commenters" checkbox, then I strongly advice you to use huge accounts. It should work in this case and promos will last longer.</p><p><br></p><p>How does it help us? You open google and type "buy boots instagram" and it gives quality links right away! There are few stores on the first positions, which I dont want push here. Sometimes google would find an article like "Top 10 &lt;your niche&gt; accounts to follow", then its even easier. Just copy those accounts and see how does it go.</p><p><br></p><p>Another great tool of finding such accounts is Instagram itself. In our boots example we just type in #boots and then start examining who creates such stores. Within 5 minutes wed be able to find a lots of suitable shops to work on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What Happens If You Dont Have A Niche</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For instance, you are just an average human being with a personal account, not selling anything. In this case I suggest to find a celebrity/celebrities which you somehow resemble and work on their accounts. If you just select a huge account like the one of Selena Gomez, you will have lower conversion, but it will surely work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Some Promos Have Low Conversion</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Some people buy fake followers. And when you target such account, you waste your auto likes, comments and follows on such dead accounts, which will never follow back.</p><p>Another reason is a bad choice of target audience. Even within same niche one promo can be 25% and another one 5%. So just keep trying to find good promos and get rid of bad ones.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other Settings To Consider</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In our example we sell boots, so we have to set a Gender filter. It hides within Settings --&gt; General --&gt; Check Gender. We set it to Female.</p></div>'

By other words, its important that your Instagram account doesn’t look fake or spammy.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h2>Enable notifications from Instagram</h2></div><div><div><p>Ensure you’re using a correct email with Instagram so you’ll get email notifications on your account status.

Instalex allows you to like, comment, follow and unfollow. However, for the first few days of using our service, we suggest that you start out with the Likes function only.

          'What is Bitcoin?', 
          '<div><p>Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. No one controls it. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros – they’re produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems.</p><p>It’s the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency.</p><h2></h2><h2>What makes it different from normal currencies?</h2><div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gc2en3nHxA4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Bitcoin can be used to buy things electronically. In that sense, it’s like conventional dollars, euros, or yen, which are also traded digitally.</p><p>However, bitcoin’s most important characteristic, and the thing that makes it different to conventional money, is that it is&nbsp;<em>decentralized</em>. No single institution controls the bitcoin network. This puts some people at ease, because it means that a large bank can’t control their money.</p><h2>Who created it?</h2><p>A software developer called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>&nbsp;proposed bitcoin, which was an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof. The idea was to produce a currency independent of any central authority, transferable electronically, more or less instantly, with very low transaction fees.</p><h2>Who prints it?</h2><p><a href="http://srv-uk.znaptag.com/p/B9gCxd?key=Z7507713" id="ZnapTag_PlaceHolder_680719"><img alt="" class="alignnone" height="407" src="http://znaptag-uk.s3.amazonaws.com/680719.400.jpg" style="margin: 0px; color: transparent; height: auto; cursor: pointer;" width="612"></a></p><p>No one. This currency isn’t physically printed in the shadows by a central bank, unaccountable to the population, and making its own rules. Those banks can simply produce more money to cover the national debt, thus devaluing their currency.</p><p>Instead, bitcoin is created digitally, by a community of people that anyone can join. Bitcoins are ‘<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-bitcoin-mining-works/">mined’</a>, using computing power in a distributed network.</p><p>This network also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-do-bitcoin-transactions-work/">processes transactions</a>&nbsp;made with the virtual currency, effectively making bitcoin its own payment network.</p><h2>So you can’t churn out unlimited bitcoins?</h2><p>That’s right. The bitcoin protocol – the rules that make bitcoin work – say that only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created by miners. However, these coins can be divided into smaller parts (the smallest divisible amount is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin and is called a ‘Satoshi’, after the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/">founder of bitcoin</a>).</p><h2>What is bitcoin based on?</h2><p>Conventional currency has been based on gold or silver. Theoretically, you knew that if you handed over a dollar at the bank, you could get some gold back (although this didn’t actually work in practice). But bitcoin isn’t based on gold; it’s based on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/">mathematics</a>.</p><p>Around the world, people are using software programs that follow a mathematical formula to produce bitcoins. The mathematical formula is freely available, so that anyone can check it.</p><p>The software is also open source, meaning that anyone can look at it to make sure that it does what it is supposed to.</p><h2>What are its characteristics?</h2><p>Bitcoin has several important features that set it apart from government-backed currencies.</p><h4><strong>1. Its decentralized</strong></h4><p>The bitcoin network isn’t controlled by one central authority. Every machine that mines bitcoin and processes transactions makes up a part of the network, and the machines work together. That means that, in theory, one central authority can’t tinker with monetary policy and cause a meltdown – or simply decide to take people’s bitcoins away from them, as the Central European Bank&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Cypriot_financial_crisis" target="_blank">decided to do</a>&nbsp;in Cyprus in early 2013. And if some part of the network goes offline for some reason, the money keeps on flowing.</p><h4><strong>2. Its easy to set up</strong></h4><p>Conventional banks make you jump through hoops simply to open a bank account. Setting up merchant accounts for payment is another Kafkaesque task, beset by bureaucracy. However, you can set up a bitcoin address in seconds, no questions asked, and with no fees payable.</p><h4><strong>3. Its anonymous</strong></h4><p>Well, kind of. Users can hold multiple bitcoin addresses, and they aren’t linked to names, addresses, or other personally identifying information. However…</p><h4><strong>4. Its completely transparent</strong></h4><p>…bitcoin stores details of every single transaction that ever happened in the network in a huge version of a general ledger, called the&nbsp;<strong>blockchain</strong>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-glossary/#blockchain">blockchain</a>&nbsp;tells all.</p><p>If you have a publicly used bitcoin address, anyone can tell how many bitcoins are stored at that address. They just don’t know that it’s yours.</p><p>There are measures that people can take to make their activities more opaque on the bitcoin network, though, such as not using the same bitcoin addresses consistently, and not transferring lots of bitcoin to a single address.</p><h4><strong>5. Transaction fees are miniscule</strong></h4><p>Your bank may charge you a £10 fee for international transfers. Bitcoin doesn’t.</p><h4><strong>6. It’s fast</strong></h4><p>You can send money anywhere and it will arrive minutes later, as soon as the bitcoin network processes the payment.</p><h4><strong>7. It’s non-repudiable</strong></h4><p>When your bitcoins are sent, there’s no getting them back, unless the recipient returns them to you. They’re gone forever.</p><p>So, bitcoin has a lot going for it, in theory. But how does it work, in practice?

          '<div><p>Bitcoin wallets store the private keys that you need to access a bitcoin address and spend your funds. They come in different forms, designed for different types of device. You can even use paper storage to avoid having them on a computer at all. Of course, it is very important to secure and back up your bitcoin wallet.</p><p><br></p><p>Bitcoins are a modern equivalent of cash and, every day, another merchant starts accepting them as payment. We know how&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-bitcoin-mining-works/">they are generated</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-do-bitcoin-transactions-work/">how a bitcoin transaction works</a>, but how are they stored? We store fiat cash in a physical wallet, and bitcoin works in a similar way, except its normally digital.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2013/08/bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets.jpg"><img alt="Bitcoin paper, coin and USB wallets" class="wp-image-14803 size-article-full" height="420" src="http://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2013/08/bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets-630x420.jpg" width="630" style="cursor: pointer;"></a></p><p><br></p><p>Bitcoin paper, coin and USB wallets</p><p><br></p><p>Well, to be absolutely accurate, you dont technically&nbsp;<em>store</em>&nbsp;bitcoins anywhere. What you store are the secure digital keys used to access your public bitcoin addresses and sign transactions. This information is stored in a bitcoin wallet.</p><p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/companies/wallets/">Bitcoin wallets</a>&nbsp;come in a variety of forms. There are five&nbsp;main types of wallet: desktop, mobile, web, paper and hardware. Here’s how they work.</p><h2>Desktop wallets</h2><p>If you have already installed the original bitcoin client (<a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download" target="_blank">Bitcoin Core</a>), then you are running a wallet, but may not even know it. In addition to relaying transactions on the network, this software also enables you to create a bitcoin address for sending and receiving the virtual currency, and to store the private key for it.</p><p>There are other desktop wallets too, all with different features.&nbsp;<a href="https://multibit.org/">MultiBit</a>&nbsp;runs on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hivewallet.com/" target="_blank">Hive</a>&nbsp;is an OS X-based wallet with some unique features, including an app store that connects directly to bitcoin services.</p><p>Some desktop wallets are tailored for enhanced security:&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinarmory.com/">Armory</a>&nbsp;falls into this category.</p><p>Others focus on anonymity:&nbsp;<a href="https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/">DarkWallet</a>&nbsp;– uses a lightweight browser plug-in to provide services including coin ‘mixing’ in which users’ coins are exchanged for others’, to prevent people tracking them.</p><h2>Mobile wallets</h2><p>Desktop-based wallets are all very well, but they arent very useful if you are out on the street, trying to pay for something in a physical store. This is where a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-apps-for-android-iphone-and-windows-phone/">mobile wallet</a>&nbsp;comes in handy. Running as an app on your smartphone, the wallet can store the private keys for your bitcoin addresses, and enable you to pay for things directly with your phone.</p><p><br></p><p>In some cases, a bitcoin wallet will even take advantage of a smartphone’s near-field communication (NFC) feature, enabling you to tap the phone against a reader and pay with bitcoins without having to enter any information at all.</p><p><br></p><p>One common feature of mobile wallets is that they are not full bitcoin clients. A full bitcoin client has to download the entire bitcoin blockchain, which is always growing and is multiple gigabytes in size. That could get you into a heap of trouble with your mobile service provider, who will be only too happy to send you a hefty bill for downloading it over a cellular link. Many phones wouldnt be able to hold the blockchain in their memory, in any case.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, these mobile clients are often designed with simplified payment verification (SPV) in mind. They download a very small subset of the blockchain, and rely on other, trusted nodes in the bitcoin network to ensure that they have the right information.</p><p><br></p><p>Examples of mobile wallets include the Android based&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet">Bitcoin&nbsp;</a><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet" style="background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);">wallet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet" style="background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);">Mycelium</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xapo" rel="nofollow" style="background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);" target="_blank">Xapo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/android-app" style="background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;(which keeps your bitcoin keys encrypted on your phone, and backed up on a web-based server).</p><p><br></p><p>Apple is notoriously paranoid about bitcoin wallets. Coinbase had its mobile wallet app&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-bitcoin-app-apple-app-store/">pulled from the app store</a>&nbsp;altogether in November 2013, and this was followed in February 2014 by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/apple-removes-blockchain-bitcoin-wallet-from-app-stores/">removal of Blockchain’s iOS app</a>. However, in July 2014, bitcoin wallet apps began&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-returns-apple-ios-new-bitcoin-wallet/">reappear</a>&nbsp;on the iOS store, and now all of the major bitcoin wallet providers have released new editions of their previous apps.</p><p><br></p><p><img alt="Aegis Wallet Wear Moto 360" class="wp-image-127350 size-full" height="423" src="http://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2014/09/aegis-wallet-moto360.jpg" width="630"></p><p><br></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aegiswallet&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Aegis Bitcoin Wallet</a>&nbsp;even supports android smartwatches</p><p><br></p><p>There are also other types of wallets that can be used on a mobile, such as the browser-based wallet&nbsp;<a href="https://coinpunk.com/" target="_blank">CoinPunk</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;developing. Another unusual wallet is the<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/aegis-wallet-wear-brings-bitcoin-android-smartwatches/">&nbsp;Aegis Bitcoin Wallet</a>, which supports&nbsp;Android smartwatches.</p><h2>Online wallets</h2><p>Web-based wallets store your private keys online, on a computer controlled by someone else and connected to the Internet. Several such online services are available, and some of them link to mobile and desktop wallets, replicating your addresses between different devices that you own.</p><p>One advantage of web-based wallets is that you can access them from anywhere, regardless of which device you are using. However, they also have one major disadvantage: unless implemented correctly, they can put the organisation running the website in charge of your private keys – essentially taking your bitcoins out of your control. That’s a scary thought, especially if you begin to accrue lots of bitcoins.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://coinde.sk/1KJM4D6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, an integrated wallet/bitcoin exchange operates its online wallet worldwide. Users in the US and Europe can buy bitcoin through its exchange services.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.circle.com/en" target="_blank">Circle</a>&nbsp;offers users worldwide the chance to store, send, receive and buy bitcoins. Currently only US citizens are able to link bank accounts to deposit funds, but credit and debit cards are also an option for users in other countries.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://blockchain.info/">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;also hosts a popular web-based wallet, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strongcoin.com/">Strongcoin</a>&nbsp;offers what it calls a hybrid wallet, which lets you encrypt your private address keys before sending them to its servers – encryption is carried out in the browser.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://xapo.com/r/BTTKO9R" target="_blank">Xapo</a>&nbsp;aims to provide the&nbsp;convenience of an simple bitcoin wallet with the added security of a cold-storage vault.</p><h2>Hardware wallets</h2><p>Hardware wallets are currently very limited in number.

On the other, it is completely transparent and trackable. &nbsp;Due to this fact, bitcoin is often cited as being pseudonymous.</p><p>This fact resulted in some companies emerging with the goal of controversially&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-tracking-proposal-divides-bitcoin-community/">tracking suspect transactions</a>&nbsp;to police the blockchain. To counter this, ideas were developed in the bitcoin community to take anonymity further, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/merge-avoidance-privacy-bitcoin/">merge avoidance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/stealth-addresses-secret-bitcoin-privacy/">stealth addresses</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/market-based-reactions-new-bitcoin-regulation/">coin mixing</a>.</p><p>The alpha version of&nbsp;<a href="http://darkwallet.is/" target="_blank">Dark Wallet</a>&nbsp;– a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/dark-wallet-crowdfunding-campaign/" target="_blank">crowdfunded</a>&nbsp;bitcoin wallet&nbsp;– went&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today/">live in May 2014</a>. Created by Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet was designed to provide&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/shining-dim-light-dark-wallet/">new tools for financial privacy</a>, including in-built coin mixing and stealth wallet addresses. At the time of writing, the developers are urging users to use the testnet with play money to iron out bugs before risking significant amounts of&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>Wallets and services like Dark Wallet ultimately mean that using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-is-as-anonymous-as-you-want-it-to-be/">bitcoin can be as anonymous as you want it to be</a>.</p><h2>How can I secure my wallet?</h2><p>There are several ways to make your bitcoin wallet more secure:</p><h3>Encrypt it</h3><p>One way to protect your wallet from prying eyes is to encrypt it with a strong password. This makes it difficult to access your wallet, but not impossible. If your computer is compromised by malware, thieves could log your keystrokes to find your password.</p><h3>Back it up</h3><p>If you have your private keys stored in one wallet, but&nbsp;you mislay that wallet or it gets corrupted, you will lose your keys. Backing up your wallet makes a copy of your private keys, but its important to back up your&nbsp;<em>whole</em>&nbsp;wallet. Some addresses are used to store change from transactions, and may not be shown to you by default. Back up the whole wallet&nbsp;in several different places, and keep them safe from prying eyes.</p><h3>Use multisig</h3><p>The number of services which support&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/year-multisig-so-far/">multi-signature transactions</a>&nbsp;is increasing. Multi-signature addresses allow multiple parties to partially seed an address with a public key. When someone wants to spend some of the bitcoins, they need some of these people to sign their transaction in addition to themselves. The required&nbsp;number of signatures is agreed at the start when people create the address.</p><p>Since multiple signatures are needed before funds can be spent, the additional signatures could come from, say, a business partner, your significant other, or even from a second device which you own, to add a second factor to spending your coins.</p><h3>Take it offline</h3><p><a href="http://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2013/08/safe-with-cash-inside.jpg"><img alt="Safe with cash inside" class="alignright size-large wp-image-14809" height="185" src="http://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2013/08/safe-with-cash-inside-300x185.jpg" width="300" style="cursor: pointer;"></a></p><p><br></p><p>If you are too nervous to store your bitcoin keys digitally, for fear that they may be stolen by hackers, there is another option: ‘cold storage’. Cold storage wallets store private bitcoin keys offline, so that they can’t be stolen by someone else on the Internet.</p><p>It’s a good idea to use cold storage for the bulk of your bitcoin fortune, and transfer just a little to separate bitcoin addresses in a ‘hot’ wallet with an Internet connection, making it easy to spend. That way, even if your mobile phone is lost, or the hot wallet on your notebook PC is erased during a hard drive crash, only a small amount of bitcoin cash is at risk.</p><p>Many software bitcoin wallets feature a cold storage option.&nbsp;Or, you could go completely analogue, and simply use paper wallets for offline storage.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Paper wallet image via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zcopley/8705948289/" target="_blank">zcopley</a>&nbsp;/ Flickr</em></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-to-store-your-bitcoins/">http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-to-store-your-bitcoins/</a>&nbsp;- origial text<br>article from&nbsp;</p></div>'

          '<div><h3>Address</h3><p>A Bitcoin address looks like a long string of random letters and numbers. Addresses are used when you want to send or receive Bitcoins. Each wallet has at least one receiving and one sending address. When you want to receive Bitcoins to your wallet you need to give the sender your receiving wallet address.</p><h3>AML and KYC</h3><p>Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer is a group of laws in the United States that require Bitcoin sellers to know who their customers are. Certain sellers will ask for your identification to comply with these laws. Other countries around the world may have similar laws and requirements.</p><h3>Blockchain</h3><p>The Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoins. It’s what makes it work. Bitcoin transactions are sent to the blockchain so that miners can put them into the blocks that they mine. Once a block containing your transaction is mined it has been added to the blockchain and your transaction receives one confirmation.</p><h3>Blockchain.info</h3><p>Not to be confused with the blockchain, blockchain.info is one of many websites that work as blockchain explorers. These websites allow you to ‘see’ the blockchain and what’s going on in it. In practical terms this lets you view your transactions and see if they are confirmed or not. You can also check to see how many unconfirmed transactions there are, the more the longer it will take for your transaction to become confirmed.</p><h3>Bitcoin Block</h3><p>A Bitcoin block is one “link” in the blockchain. One block contains a group of Bitcoin transactions that have been confirmed. When Bitcoin miners ‘mine’ these blocks they calculate through computer algorithms which when put in the blockchain, confirms transactions. In turn miners receive transaction fees and newly created Bitcoins for confirming transactions.</p><h3>BTC/Coin</h3><p>BTC is the acronym for Bitcoin. Coin, coins et. al. are also slang terms for Bitcoin.</p><h3>Circle/Coinbase</h3><p>Two Bitcoin exchanges based in the U.S. that require you to verify your identity before being allowed to trade, along with other limitations.</p><h3>Cold storage/Cold wallet</h3><p>This refers to a way of storing Bitcoins in a safe and secure way, offline. This is also how the vast majority of Bitcoins LocalBitcoins hold on to are stored.</p><h3>Confirmation</h3><p>For a Bitcoin transaction to be completed it needs to be confirmed. Good habits are to wait for at least 3-6 confirmations before you can consider a transaction good. A confirmation happens when a transaction has been added to a block that Bitcoin miners successfully mine.</p><h3>Exchange</h3><p>An exchange is a platform/service where users can change one type of currency for another.</p><h3>Fiat</h3><p>Fiat comes from Latin and means “let it be done” or “it shall be”. It’s used as a term to mean all currencies that derive their value from governmental regulation or other central authorities.</p><h3>Hot wallet</h3><p>The opposite of a cold wallet / cold storage. A hot wallet is located on a computer connected to the internet. At LocalBitcoins the hot wallet is where we store a small amount of Bitcoins at a time. It’s from here where your transactions are sent. We only keep a very small amount of Bitcoin here to protect ourselves from hackers.</p><h3>LBC</h3><p>LBC is where you are, it’s the acronym for LocalBitcoins :)</p><h3>Mining</h3><p>This is what Bitcoin Miners do in order to confirm transactions and add them to the blockchain. When a Bitcoin miner mines, he uses computers to do difficult calculations which answers are easily proven to be correct. This way, when a miner completes a calculation anyone can easily see that the miner has actually done work. This work can then be used to create a Bitcoin block. What miners get in return from mining is new Bitcoins and transaction fees.</p><h3>Multisig</h3><p>Multisignature, often heard in combination with wallet. A multisignature wallet is one that has several cryptographic keys concerned with it. This way if you have two of three keys, say, you can move money out of it. But with only one you cannot do anything.</p><h3>P2P</h3><p>Peer-to-Peer. It’s a form of network structure. Rather than having everything go via a centralized node, in a peer-to-peer structure everything goes from user to user. There’s no centralized part to rely on.</p><h3>Satoshi</h3><p>A satoshi is the smallest amount of Bitcoin that can be sent, or 0.00000001 BTC.</p><h3>Satoshi Nakamoto</h3><p>The pseudonym of the person who invented Bitcoin. No one knows who he is, but he does own quite a nice amount of BTC.</p><h3>SEPA</h3><p>Single Euro Payment Area, SEPA transfers are a special kind of bank transfers within the EU.</p><h3>Transaction</h3><p>A Bitcoin transaction, the actual act of moving Bitcoin from one wallet to another.</p><h3>Transaction fee</h3><p>Since the Bitcoin miners work to confirm your transactions, they won’t do this for free. Rather you pay a tiny amount of Bitcoin to them to help them continue to confirm. This is why each time you move Bitcoin, it costs a tiny bit.</p><h3>txid</h3><p>Transaction Id. This is a long string of numbers and letters that is the ID of a single transaction. It’s handy to know as you can paste this into a blockchain explorer and see what’s up with your transaction. It’s mainly used to see how many confirmations a transaction has.</p><h3>Wallet</h3><p>The place where you store your Bitcoins. This can be quite confusing to new users, but a wallet is essentially just a Bitcoin address. A Bitcoin wallet can exist on a service such as LocalBitcoins, in an app on your phone or computer, or even on a piece of paper! As it’s just a series of numbers and letters it does not matter where it’s stored. It’s completely OK to use your LocalBitcoins account as your wallet when you’re still new. But when you start to accumulate more and more Bitcoin you way want to think of different ways to store them.</p></div>'
