                  <p><b>4.2</b> It is prohibited to start several similar jobs / algorithms at the same time or to use different sites / services for the promotion. In some cases, due to technical features of the promotion process, this may entail the provision of services not in full volume. In this case, the refund to the user’s personal account on the site is not provided.</p>
                  <p><b>Technical features</b></p>
                  <p><b>5.1</b> From time to time, the site may suspend the provision of services. This happens due to security and service improvement measures.</p>

                  <p><b>Blocking of users</b></p>
                  <p><b>9.1</b> An attempt to hack a site, to cheat money, to deceive or communicate with the service administration in an offensive way is considered to be violation of the rules and entails permanent blocking of the user’s account without the possibility of a refund.</p>
